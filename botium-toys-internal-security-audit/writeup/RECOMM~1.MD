# Recommendations – Botium Toys

## Priority 1 (Immediate)
1. **Least privilege + separation of duties**
   - Restrict access to customer PII and cardholder data to only employees who require it.
   - Reduces insider risk and limits the impact of compromised accounts.

2. **Encryption for sensitive data**
   - Encrypt customer cardholder data and sensitive information stored/processed/transmitted internally.
   - Improves confidentiality and supports PCI DSS/GDPR alignment.

## Priority 2 (Near-term)
3. **Backups + disaster recovery plan**
   - Implement regular backups of critical data and test restoration.
   - Create a formal disaster recovery plan to support business continuity.

4. **Intrusion detection system (IDS)**
   - Deploy IDS to improve detection of suspicious activity and potential intrusions.

## Priority 3 (Ongoing improvements)
5. **Centralized password management**
   - Reduce password fatigue and improve enforcement of stronger password standards.

6. **Formalize legacy system monitoring**
   - Document monitoring and maintenance procedures and set a regular schedule.

7. **Data classification and inventory**
   - Classify assets and data to better understand risk and improve compliance readiness.
