# Audit Summary – Botium Toys

## Scope
The audit scope covers the entire security program at Botium Toys, including assets, internal processes, and procedures related to controls and compliance.

## Goals
- Assess existing assets and security posture
- Complete the controls and compliance checklist
- Identify missing controls and compliance gaps to improve security posture

## Risk summary (high-level)
Botium Toys has several security gaps that increase risk to customer data and business continuity:
- Broad internal access to sensitive data (including cardholder data and PII/SPII)
- No encryption for cardholder data stored/processed internally
- No backups and no disaster recovery plan
- No intrusion detection system (IDS)
- Password policy exists but is weak and not centrally enforced
- Legacy systems are monitored, but monitoring procedures and schedules are unclear

## Conclusion
The organization should prioritize access control, encryption, detection, and recovery controls to reduce risk and improve compliance.
