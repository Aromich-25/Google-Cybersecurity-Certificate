# Methodology (How I built my answers)

To complete this audit, I used the provided scope/goals and risk assessment report as the primary source of truth for whether each control and compliance best practice was currently in place.

I referenced control category guidance to connect each item to administrative, technical, or physical controls. I treated each checklist question as an “exists vs. not implemented” decision, and then prioritized recommendations based on which gaps created the highest security and business continuity risk.

This approach mirrors how internal audits work in real environments: review available documentation, identify control gaps, connect gaps to risk, and propose a prioritized remediation plan.
