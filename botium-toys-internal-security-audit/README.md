# Botium Toys – Internal Security Audit (Controls & Compliance)

## Overview
This project documents an internal security audit for a fictional company, **Botium Toys**, based on a scenario from the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. I reviewed the provided scope/goals and risk assessment, evaluated current controls, assessed compliance alignment, and produced prioritized recommendations.

## What I did
- Reviewed the audit scope, goals, assets, and risk assessment
- Completed a **controls assessment checklist**
- Completed a **compliance checklist** for:
  - PCI DSS
  - GDPR
  - SOC (Type 1 / Type 2)
- Wrote prioritized recommendations to reduce risk and improve security posture

## Key takeaways
- Missing access controls (least privilege/separation of duties) increases the risk of data exposure
- Lack of encryption impacts confidentiality and compliance (especially PCI DSS/GDPR)
- Lack of backups and disaster recovery plans creates a major business continuity risk
- IDS capability would improve detection and visibility
