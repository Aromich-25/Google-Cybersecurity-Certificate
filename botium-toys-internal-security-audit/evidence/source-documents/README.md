# Source Documents (Reference Materials)

This folder contains the reference documents that were provided as part of the
Botium Toys internal security audit scenario and were used to inform my analysis.

These documents represent the inputs to the audit process and were reviewed
to understand the organization’s environment, assets, risks, and control categories.
They are not answer keys and do not contain completed solutions.

## Purpose of these documents
- To define the audit scope, goals, and risk context
- To identify assets and understand potential impacts to security and compliance
- To provide reference guidance on control categories and control types

## How they were used
- The scope, goals, and risk assessment document were used to determine which
  Security controls and compliance best practices were currently in place.
- The control categories reference was used to distinguish between
  administrative, technical, and physical controls and to understand their purpose.

## Notes
- Final findings, decisions, and recommendations are documented separately
  in the completed checklist and written audit summary.
- These documents are included for transparency and to demonstrate methodology.
  similar to how reference materials are used during real-world security audits.
